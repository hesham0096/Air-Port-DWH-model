# Air-Port-DWH-model

The project contains:

-Detailed documentation for all the business processes along with the assumptions wev'e made.
-DWH model (Business Layer).
-DWH Schema.
- 3NF model for the second layer included in the detailed documentation.

Project Description:

This model is especially design to assist the management of the famous airline company British Airway to make better data-driven decisions and to discover new opportunities to expand their business. They have specific business requirements that we’ll elaborate and fulfill later on in this documentation. 

Why-Three Layer Architecture Approach 
We’ve choose 3-Layer Architecture approach as it initially covers complete business areas and combines data according to current needs in a subsequent step. In contrast, the 2-layer Architecture Approach for Large-Scale Data Warehouse Systems defines DW based on actual users’ requirements. This leads to higher complexity and higher volume of extracted data. More conceptual work is necessary, so that duration and costs of the implementation are affected.
